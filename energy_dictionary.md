*  __Fixed Costs__ - The cost that is always present no matter the amount of production. For example, rent on a building that produces commodities.

*  __Levelised Cost Of Electricity (LCOE)__ - The price at which generated power must be sold in order to break-even. The true LCOE may vary according to policy/incentives, region, or time of day or year. Therefore, for example when averaged, LCOE may hide the true cost of a power generating technology.

*  __Levelised Avoided Cost Of Electricity (LACE)__ - The levelised cost of electricity that has been displaced by a new resource. So it's a good measure of the value added by the new energy source (if the previous source was very expensive, the new resource is supplying something that was highly valued). Remember, the electricity that was displaced was likely provided by multiple sources of energy at different costs over the time supplied, so a weighted average should be taken. 

*  __Operating Margin__ - The profit per Â£1 spent on Variable Costs before tax/interest. Higher values indicates a higher efficiency of turning sales into profits.

*  __Primary Energy__ - The amount of energy released by an energy-releasing process before conversion. Energy sources which couple to an electricity grid inefficiently will be required to produce more Primary Energy in order to account for losses, meaning this metric is often misleading.

*  __Variable Costs__ - The cost associated with producing one additional unit of a commodity. Increased production increases the total variable costs. For example, this may be spent on materials or production time if production is serial.

*  __Net Present Value__ - The value of future assets discounted to provide a value of how much they are worth today.

*  __Internal Rate Of Return__ - The discount rate that is required in order to make the NPV of all cash flows equal to zero (NPV_revenues-NPV_costs). It can be thought of as the rate of growth that an investment is estimated to generate annually; if an investment grows in value at the discount rate, then the final value is 0. The higher the IRR, the more desirable an investment - although NPV is an equivalent but superior metric (IRR offers no more information as discount rate is varied). 

*  __Nominal__ - If discussing the "nominal cost", then what is being referred to is the stated cost - without, for example, correcting for inflation of discounting etc. The real cost is typically relative to the cost of other economic resources such as labour or capital. If the real cost decreases, it is equivalent to saying that the commodity can be produced more efficiently - requiring less machinery. 

*  __Annuity__ - A series of regular cash flows. Annuity payments toward a debt are constant (think a mortgage, where the payments towards principal and interest changes over the debt lifetime) whereas level principal payments repay the principal in constant amounts, so the interest owed decreases much faster, and so the total repayments get smaller.

*  __OPEX vs Variable Costs__?

*  __Final Energy__ - The energy delivered for use in sectors of the economy

*  __Useful Energy__ - The portion of final energy used to provide energy services, such as heat, light, and kinetic energy

*  __Mean Reversion__ - The tendency for volatile asset prices to converge to a historic mean

*  __Merit order__ - A method of ranking available power-generating technologies such that low marginal cost technologies are dispatched with priority. The aim is to minimise the overall cost of electricity, given that the production cost of the marginal producer sets the market price (clears the market). 

* __Capitalised Cost__ - An accounting practice (e.g. in GAAP) whereby fixed costs may be moved from the expense side of the balance sheet to the asset side i.e. instead of appearing as one massive, overnight expense, they initially appear as an asset that is slowly depreciated/amortised. This cash flow, which can be tax-deductible (known as capital or depreciation allowance, creating a "tax shield"), accounts for the principle value of the capital whilst any accrued interest also appears separately; i.e. think of a monthly home mortgage payment which is split into interest payments and repayments of the principle - the latter of which become tax-deductible. __Depreciation__ typically applies to fixed, tangible assets, and the asset's decreasing value can be modelled in many ways: as a "straight line" (fixed depreciation e.g. 1000 per year), an exponential ("declining balance" or e.g. 20% of *current value* - so minus previous cumulative depreciation) per year; "double declining balance", which means double the equivalent straight line rate at year 1, expressed as a % i.e. for 10k asset with lifetime 10 it declines at 20% each year; "sum of years", where depreciation is [lifetime-year-1]/[lifetime*lifetime-1-2-3...-lifetime]; "compound interest"/"annuity" methods, where depreciation is constant - as in straight line - but the level is set by the potential/total value of the project, not the initial fixed cost); or as some function of production (e.g. 1000 per 20 units produced by the asset if e.g. a factory). The capital/depreciation allowance - the amount that can be deducted (not always 100%) - depends on jurisdiction e.g. 50% super-deduction/100% first year allowances in the UK or [MACRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACRS) in the [US](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946). __Amortisation__ applies to intangible assets - e.g. patents or copyrights - hence typically uses the "straight line basis" (i.e. constant depreciation) since the real value degradation is hard to measure. Essentially, these methods of depreciation and amortisation each define a different curve shape that describes an asset's decreasing value through time. Tax which is delayed owing to depreciation is called __deferred income tax__. The advantage of depreciation is that income statements and balance sheets more accurately represent a company (revenues and expenses more easily balance and better represent the real performance, since costs should reflect creation of profit), represent them in a better light (such that huge debts from fixed costs do not make the company appear to be in huge trouble), and - importantly - enables companies to reduce tax expenditures through capital allowances (otherwise, they would saturate their allowance overnight as they purchase the asset before having no allowances in future - which incentivises against capital investments exceeding a certain size). A real example of this applied in an audit of Korean nuclear reactors can be found [here](https://home.kepco.co.kr/kepco/EN/ntcob/list.do?boardCd=BRD_000259&menuCd=EN030201).  

* __Balance Sheet__ - A record of a firm's assets - everything owned and owed.

* __Income Statement__ - A record of a firm's revenues, expenses, and net income and losses. Prepared on an accrual basis, meaning revenues/expenses are recorded when earned or incurred, regardless of when cash is received or paid. An example for a nuclear reactor can be found on p94 [here](https://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/trs437_web.pdf).

* __Cash Flow Statement__ - A record of a firm's cash flows, prepared on a cash basis i.e. when the inflows or outflows actually occur.

* __Imputed Interest__ - The interest rate assigned to debt by someone according to the current market rate, regardless of whether that is indeed the interest rate in place on that debt. E.g. a lender may set an interest rate of zero - on e.g. an overdraft - but some authorities may consider that debt issued at a given market rate. 

* __Working Capital__ - The difference between a company's short-term assets (raw materials and accounts receivable i.e. money owed to the company) and liabilities (taxes, accounts payable i.e. money the company owes others). E.g. if a company spends 10 producing a product which a customer promises to buy for 30, then the company has invested 10 in working capital before investing a further 20 in working capital - when they finally sell the product and receive the money they disinvest 30 from their working capital and that 30 is recorded as a cash inflow.

* __Factors Of Production__ - Factors of production are resources which are used in production, classically being land, labour, capital and enterprise. 

* __Bond__ - A formal debt investment, usually tradeable, issued by a borrowing organisation and bought by a lender (= debt investor). Essentially a formal document evidencing a loan.

* __Loan__ - A loan is a borrowing (liability) for the borrower, and an investment (asset) for the lender.

* __Fiduciary Juty__ - A fiduciary duty is a legal duty to act solely in another party's interests. A fiduciary is a person who occupies a position of trust in relation to someone else and is required to act for the latter's benefit within the scope of that relationship. Examples include trustees and company directors. Stewardship is the fundamental fiduciary duty of company directors, to safeguard and administer the property belonging to a company, on behalf of its shareholders.    

* __Debt Service__ - The payments made to satisfy debt obligations - including interest and principal. For example, your annual mortgage payment is a debt service. 

* __Annual Debt Service Coverage Ratio__ - The ratio of annual cash flows (liquid cash revenues minus costs, ignoring things like depreciation) to debt service. For example, if your mortgage is 100 per year and you earn 150 then the ADSCR is 1.5. This cover shows how able you are to make debt payments. It can also be used to optimise debt leveraging: a lender may stipulate a specific ADSCR, whilst the project wants to maximise leverage. The system is optimised by varying the leverage, which varies the required interest payments (higher leverage = higher interest payments), which can be increased until the required ADSCR is reached. Higher leverages can decrease prices, since it makes projects more profitable; the equity invested also decreases (from 80:20 to 90:10 means equity only needs to return half what it was returning before) faster than interest costs increase (debt from 0.8 to 0.9 is a smaller fractional increase than 0.2 to 0.1). So even though a project with low leverage might have higher profit (and even benefit from a lower interest rate on debt), it will still yield a lower return on equity invested. Fixing the ADSCR can also help optimise loan repayments; the reason why mortgages charge the same amount each year (and vary the principal and interest payments) is to keep the ADSCR fixed - if principal payments were fixed then ADSCR would start high and tail off, which means increased risk in early years/low early investor dividends and missed returns on equity later.

* __Leverage__ - The ratio of a project's costs financed by debt versus financed by equity.

* __Drawdown__ - The act of drawing money out of a stock (source of value). For example, pension drawdown is removing money from the pension pot. For projects, the drawdown schedule might specify the time over which money can be drawn from the pot of investment to pay for e.g. construction. It's drawn out as slow as possible to maximise returns - hence why equity is typically drawn down last.

* __Cash Flow Cascade (Waterfall)__ - An order of priorities for which cash revenues from the project can be used for e.g. first for payment of fuel/variable costs, then later down the line investor dividends. 

* __Debt Tenor__ - The amount of time left until debt matures.
